opensslca
=========

opensslca.dll provides basic CA functionality:

* create X509 certificate request
* create X509 certificate from certificate request
* get issuer certificate
* get RA certificate

I created it as part of my diploma thesis (2007) to be able to issue digital
certificates from .NET applications.
